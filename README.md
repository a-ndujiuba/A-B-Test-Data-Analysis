# A-B-Test-Data-Analysis
This code describes the process of analysis the data from a csv file, in which an A/B test for the layout of a webpage was carried out. The code shows the trends, in grpahical formats, between three different types of webpage formats (labelled as variant 0, 1 or 2) and the user interactions that followed.

The pandas library was imported as a means of carrying out this data analysis, as well as the matplotlib.pyplot for graph plotting, and numpy for handling arrays.

The code defines a series of functions, into which the file and the variant number can be inputted to display the trend between the variant type and the ability to complete a given CTA. As well as this, various parameters were plotted against each other to understand which factors had the biggest impact of if the user carried out the desired CTA.

This project gave me a great and thorough experience of using pandas as a data analysis technique, as I really was able to obtain an understanding of a wide array of the actions that can be performed, which will hold me in great stead in solving similar problems like this going forward.
